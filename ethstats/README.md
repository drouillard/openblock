# Local Ethstats

Ethstats is a project that provides information on the state of an ethereum network. Ethstats is used
in this project to monitor the private network from the perspective of the entire network.

The ethstats project consists of a both a front-end and a back-end. They operate independently, and for the purposes of troubleshooting the running of the front-end service does not imply the back-end service is properly configured.

This project is configured such that the individual nodes 'push' their stats to Ethstats service.
