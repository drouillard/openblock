# Openblock

This project is designed to make it easy to deploy and manage a private network of Ethereum nodes.

## Architect

This project is modeled after [puppeth](https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/04/14/geth-1-6-puppeth-master/). It handles the setup and configuration of machines. Unlike puppeth which uses docker, the main requirement of Architect is a version of Node V4+

## Solar Dashboard

This project is a combination of the software required to run Geth along with a GUI dashboard that provides
insights into the activity taking place on the local node.

It was inspired by [Solar Chain Dashboard](https://github.com/tomconte/solarchain-dashboard)
